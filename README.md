# **MyToken**

The smart contract has been created using the Solidity programming language, which is essentially responsible for minting and burning tokens.

# Description

This is a smart contract written using solidity (a high-level programming language primarily used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain), which is basically responsible for minting and burning tokens. This contract has been developed utilizing a variety of functions, which have been documented and listed below.

# Public variables

The code starts with assigning public variables that store the details about the coin such as 

(TokenName = "HADES"; TokenAbbrv = "HADS" and Totalsupply)

# Mapping variables

mapping identifier is uesd to create key-value data structures.The mapping is used here to locate "Totalsupply" based on the address provided by the user.

# mint function

Adding or generating more tokens to a token's Totalsupply is accomplished by the "mint" function in the code.

# burn function

The "burn" function is utilized to effectuate the removal or destruction of tokens from the total supply. Additionally, an "if statement" has been incorporated to prevent the burning of tokens exceeding the total supply, thereby ensuring the integrity of the token balance.
